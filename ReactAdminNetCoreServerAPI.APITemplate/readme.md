# Getting started with the app Template

This app is basically a template, or recipie if you will, 
of using [Loresoft's](www.loresoft.com) DAL generator in conjunction 
with a workable [implementation](https://github.com/zachrybaker/ra-data-rest-client) of 
[react-admin's](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) data provider, 
to serve a REST API compliant with the expected REST dialect to build react-admin apps with minimal code.

Please see the readme.md in the parent directory to explain how to create a project in full detail.

And please compare the generation.yml file with a default generated file to understand the changes I made to work with the demo data.
